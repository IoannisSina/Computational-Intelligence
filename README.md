## Description - Part 1 :zap:

Use a neural network to classify texts to different labels. Check file main_optimal for optimal neural nets hyper-parameters. These parameters were used as optimal, after a number of executions using various combinations.

## Description - Part 2 :zap:

Detect most important words in given a set of texts using Genetic algorithms.

## Steps to run both parts :runner:

Clone repository and cd to desired folder
~~~
git clone https://github.com/IoannisSina/Computational-Intelligence
cd Computational-Intelligence
cd PartA or PartB
~~~

Create virtual enviroment and activate it
~~~
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate # Linux or MacOS
env\Scripts\activate # Windows
~~~

Install requirements and go to code folder
~~~
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd code
~~~

Run for PartA
~~~
python3 main_optimal # or main_1_hidden.py or main_2_hidden.py
~~~

Run for PartB
